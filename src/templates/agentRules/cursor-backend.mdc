# Backend Rules

These rules apply when working on backend code in this repository.

## Scope

This rule file applies to:
- Server-side code, APIs, endpoints
- Database schemas and migrations
- Business logic and services
- Authentication and authorization
- Background jobs, queues, workers
- Infrastructure and deployment configs

## Before Starting

1. Read core rules (\`.cursor/rules/00-core.mdc\`) - they always apply
2. Read project context (\`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md\`)
3. Read local context (\`.ai/context/repo_context/REPO_CONTEXT.md\`)

## Backend-Specific Context Updates

Update \`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md\` when backend changes affect:
- API contracts, endpoints, schemas
- Database schema or migration patterns
- Authentication/authorization flows
- Service architecture or boundaries
- Infrastructure or deployment configuration
- Environment variables or configuration

## Notes

- These rules complement (do not replace) core rules
- When working on full-stack features, also consider frontend rules
