# Core Rules (Always Apply)

These rules apply to all Cursor agent interactions in this repository.

## Context Reading (Required, No Exceptions)

**Before starting any task**, read context files in this exact order:

1. **\`${projectContextPath}\`** - Authoritative project context (read first)
2. **\`${repoContextPath}\`** - Local operational context (read second)

**If information conflicts between these files, defer to \`${projectContextPath}\`** (it's the source of truth).

## Context Updates

When your changes affect any of the following, **update \`${projectContextPath}\`** in the same branch:

- Build configuration, dependencies, tooling (\`package.json\`, \`tsconfig.json\`, etc.)
- Architecture, module boundaries, folder structure
- Development workflows, testing approaches
- APIs, schemas, contracts, interfaces

If you intentionally skip a context update, add \`[context-skip]\` to your commit message.

## Stop Conditions

- If \`${projectContextPath}\` doesn't exist, ask the user if it should be created
- If you cannot read required context files, stop and report the issue
- Never proceed without reading project context first

## Working Principles

- Project context = authoritative truth
- Local context = working memory (may be stale)
- Always prefer project context when in conflict
- Update project context proactively for impactful changes
