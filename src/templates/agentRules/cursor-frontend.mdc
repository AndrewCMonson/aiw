# Frontend Rules

These rules apply when working on frontend code in this repository.

## Scope

This rule file applies to:
- UI components, pages, views
- Client-side state management
- Frontend routing and navigation
- Styling, themes, responsive design
- Browser APIs and client-side JavaScript/TypeScript
- Frontend build tools and bundlers

## Before Starting

1. Read core rules (\`.cursor/rules/00-core.mdc\`) - they always apply
2. Read project context (\`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md\`)
3. Read local context (\`.ai/context/repo_context/REPO_CONTEXT.md\`)

## Frontend-Specific Context Updates

Update \`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md\` when frontend changes affect:
- Component architecture or design system
- State management patterns
- Routing structure
- Build configuration (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Frontend dependencies
- API client interfaces

## Notes

- These rules complement (do not replace) core rules
- When working on full-stack features, also consider backend rules
