## Operating rules (critical)

- PLAN FIRST: produce a step-by-step plan before running commands or editing files.
- STOP AFTER PLAN: wait for explicit approval before executing.
- Safety: do not request or expose secrets; never paste env var values; redact tokens.
- Persist context: write/update durable notes under \`${ws}/\` as instructed below.

## Goal

- Understand this repository and capture durable context.

## What to do

- Inspect the repo structure, entrypoints, scripts, configs, and data flows.
- Identify how to run, test, and build.
- Note key modules, boundaries, and risks.

## Artifact output (required)

- Write/update: \`${ws}/context/repo_context/REPO_CONTEXT.md\`
- Keep it concise, structured, and easy to refresh later.

## Plan format

- Plan steps
- What files/commands will be used
- What will be written to the artifact
